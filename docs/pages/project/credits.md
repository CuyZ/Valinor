# Credits & thank you

The development of this library is mainly motivated by the kind words and the
help of many people. I am grateful to everyone, especially to the [contributors]
of this repository who directly help to push the project forward.

I have to give [JetBrains] credits for providing a free ![phpstorm-logo] 
PhpStorm license for the development of this open-source package.

I also want to thank
[![blackfire-logo] Blackfire](https://www.blackfire.io/?utm_source=valinor&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=free-open-source)
for providing a license of their awesome tool, leading to notable performance
gains when using this library.
