---

Valinor takes care of the construction and validation of raw inputs (JSON, plain
arrays, etc.) into objects, ensuring a perfectly valid state. It allows the
objects to be used without having to worry about their integrity during the
whole application lifecycle.

The validation system will detect any incorrect value and help the developers by
providing precise and human-readable error messages.

The mapper can handle native PHP types as well as other advanced types supported
by [PHPStan] and [Psalm] like shaped arrays, generics, integer ranges and more.

## Installation

```bash
composer require cuyz/valinor
```

## Example

```php
final class Country
{
    public function __construct(
        /** @var non-empty-string */
        public readonly string $name,
        
        /** @var list<City> */
        public readonly array $cities,
    ) {}
}

final class City
{
    public function __construct(
        /** @var non-empty-string */
        public readonly string $name,
        
        public readonly DateTimeZone $timeZone,
    ) {}
}

$json = <<<JSON
    {
        "name": "France",
        "cities": [
            {"name": "Paris", "timeZone": "Europe/Paris"},
            {"name": "Lyon", "timeZone": "Europe/Paris"}
        ]
    }
JSON;

try {
    $country = (new \CuyZ\Valinor\MapperBuilder())
        ->mapper()
        ->map(Country::class, \CuyZ\Valinor\Mapper\Source\Source::json($json));

    echo $country->name; // France 
    echo $country->cities[0]->name; // Paris
} catch (\CuyZ\Valinor\Mapper\MappingError $error) {
    // Handle the errorâ€¦
}
```
